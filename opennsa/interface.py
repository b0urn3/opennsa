    """
    Interface for plugins.

    An OpenNSA plugin gets called when certain actions are completed, i.e,
    reserveCommit is done or a connection is terminated. I.e., hooks.

    The actions are invoked for aggregated connections only. Local connection
    information can be found by iterating through the sub connections of the
    connection.

    It is possible to get additional hooks added it is deemed a good idea.
    Currently it is somewhat modelled after what was needed for NORDUnet.
    Hooks for data plane activation and deactivation would be obvious, but
    I haven't needed it.

    See opennsa.plugin.BasePlugin for default implementation.
